# One UVA problem a day! 

The idea behind this repo is simple: I try to solve one algorithm problem from the [UVa Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php) database every day. Back when I was a CS grad student, I liked solving these programming challenges and, to keep the mind sharp, I'll solve as much as I can, as long as I remember to keep this project updated. 

I intend to follow the structure of the book "Competitive Programming 4", using the problems that are mentioned as examples in the book. The folder structure in the repo reflects the book's chapters and their subdivisions.  

You can also track my progress using the [UHunt](https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/id/949688) tool. 

Happy coding :)
